            <h2>What Is Cult of Psyche?</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                Cult of Psyche is a live-streaming sanctuary exploring consciousness, tarot, occult philosophy, and authentic community building. Hosted by Psyche &mdash; a magician, builder, and guide navigating the intersection of myth and modernity.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                What started as a stream became a movement. What started as a reading became a library. What started as a community became a mythology.
            </p>
            <p>
                800+ episodes. Thousands of hours. Countless conversations. All of it real. All of it sacred.
            </p>

            <h2>Why the Codex?</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                For years, every episode has been recorded and forgotten. Lost to the scroll. Lost to the algorithm. Lost to time. YouTube buries content. Platforms don't care about preservation. The cult's teachings were scattered across hundreds of unlabelled VODs.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                The Codex changes that.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">
                This is the complete, searchable, permanent archive of Cult of Psyche. Every episode summarized. Every guest profiled. Every teaching catalogued. Every quote preserved.
            </p>
            <p>
                No more lost episodes. No more buried wisdom. Everything is here.
